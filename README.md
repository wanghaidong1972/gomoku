## AlphaZero-Gomoku

This as basiclly a replication of this [repositoy](https://github.com/junxiaosong/AlphaZero_Gomoku)

What this program is trying to do is
 
* multiprocess to speed up MCTS (worked on Windows but failed on Mac and Linux)
* use human-played record to reduce training time ---still on working. (on a 15x15 board, it will be 
intolerably slow.)
